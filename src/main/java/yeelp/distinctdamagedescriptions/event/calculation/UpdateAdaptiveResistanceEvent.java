/**
 * This event fires every calculation to determine if a mob's resistances should
 * be updated by adaptability. This event even fires if the mob is question
 * doesn't have adaptability. <br>
 * <br>
 * The event contains the resistances and immunities used during that
 * calculation. They can't be altered, as changing them, would have no
 * effect.<br>
 * <br>
 * The event also includes a way to selectively remove certain types from
 * triggering adaptability. The event stores a clone of the damage map
 * inflicted, and calling {@link #ignoreType(DDDDamageType)} can be used to
 * prevent the mob's resistance of that type from changing. <br>
 * <br>
 * This event is not {@link Cancelable}. <br>
 * This event has a {@link Result} {@link HasResult}: <br>
 * - {@link Result#ALLOW}: Will forcefully update a mob's resistance, regardless
 * if they actually have adaptability. <br>
 * - {@link Result#DEFAULT}: Default behaviour. That is, will only update
 * adaptive resistance if the mob is actually adaptive. <br>
 * - {@link Result#DENY}: Will skip updating a mob's resistance, effectively
 * preventing their adaptability (if they have it) from kicking in.
